Ghanaian Names Generator

Learning Javascript-Ajax-async-fetch api 
i came up with this project because alot of diasporas often when in Ghana find out about our local names.
Which they end up liking and want to be called whiles here.

So you get to generate from two major Tribes here in Ghana which are the AKANS and EWES.
